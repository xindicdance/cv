# About
Xindi Cao is a Norway-based artist originally from Beijing, China, with backgrounds in philosophy, anthropology of dance, and contemporary theatre. Her artistic practice revolves around activating the body in intercultural performance using a phenomenological approach in fieldwork. Currently, her research focuses on exploring the intersection of technology, cultural identity, and embodied experience. She works with software engineers dancing in VR, Chinese immigrant families engaging with chopsticks, and Covid-19 patients dancing in cabin hospitals. In her work, she delves into the delicate realm between art and activism, blurring the lines between theatre and real life. Compared with making art, she is more interested in everyday movements, the dance outside of the theatre and how to make a living outside of the artistic production mechanism.
